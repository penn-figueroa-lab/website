<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Welcome to the Figueroa Robotics Lab</strong></h1>

<p>
The goal of our research is to study and develop the physical and perceptual adaptive intelligence necessary for robots to learn from and interact with humans, while being able to adapt to a wide range of human capabilities, needs, and ever-changing environments—achieving fluid human-robot collaborative autonomy: when humans and robots collaborate harmoniously.
</p>

<p>
We focus on applications where such fluid collaboration is necessary or safety critical, such as:
<ul>
  <li>teaching robots cumbersome dexterous manipulation tasks with minimal human effort,</li>
  <li>navigating swiftly and safely in busy human-centric spaces,</li>
  <li>physically assisting humans in heavy work and contact-rich activities,</li>
  <li>and supporting physical therapy and rehabilitation.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
We tackle these problems by developing novel and tightly coupled learning, control, and estimation algorithms that ensure stability, safety, efficiency, and robustness. Our work lies at the intersection of machine learning, control theory, artificial intelligence, perception, biomechanics, and psychology—with a strong emphasis on physical human-robot interaction.
