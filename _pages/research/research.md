# Our Research

The goal of our research is to study and develop the physical and perceptual adaptive intelligence necessary for robots
to learn from and interact with humans, while being able to adapt to a wide range of human capabilities, needs, and
ever-changing environmentsâ€”achieving fluid human-robot collaborative autonomy: when humans and robots collaborate harmoniously.
